# EAS Build Ignore File
# This file tells EAS what NOT to upload.
# Unlike .gitignore, we typically WANT to upload configuration files to the build server.

# Standard ignores
node_modules/
.expo/
.expo-shared/
npm-debug.*
*.jks
*.p8
*.p12
*.key
*.mobileprovision
*.orig.*
web-build/
dist/
.DS_Store
.metro-health-check*

# Note: We are NOT ignoring .env, config/aiConfig.js, or config/ocrConfig.js
# This ensures they are uploaded to the builder so the app works.
